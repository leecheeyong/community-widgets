          1. Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Custom API Dashboard itself does
          <span class="font-bold text-blue-600"
            >not collect, store, or share</span
          >
          any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          However, when you install and use third-party APIs within the app,
          those APIs may collect information such as your IP address and other
          data as part of their functionality. This is outside of our control,
          and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party
          API services you integrate with the app to understand how they collect
          and use your data.

          2. Third-Party APIs
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Custom API Dashboard allows you to integrate with third-party APIs.
          These APIs may collect certain data, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">IP Address:</span> Used for analytics,
            troubleshooting, and security during your interaction with
            third-party services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</span>
            Some third-party services may use cookies, beacons, or other
            tracking technologies to track activity within their specific
            services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The third-party APIs integrated within Custom API Dashboard are
          governed by their own privacy policies. We do not control or assume
          responsibility for the data collection practices of these third-party
          services.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-purple-700">
          3. Data Security
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          While Custom API Dashboard does not collect any personal data, we
          strive to ensure that your experience with the app is secure. Any data
          shared with third-party APIs will be subject to their own security
          measures. We recommend reviewing their privacy practices to ensure
          that you are comfortable with their terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2 text-purple-700">
          4. Data Sharing
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Custom API Dashboard does
          <span class="font-bold text-purple-600"
            >not share, sell, or lease</span
          >
          any data that we collect because we do not collect personal
          information. However, as stated earlier, the third-party APIs may
          collect and use your data according to their own privacy policies.
        </p>

          5. Your Rights and Choices
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Since Custom API Dashboard does not collect personal data directly, we
          do not offer specific rights regarding your personal data. However,
          you have the option to control the data shared with third-party
          services by adjusting the settings within their respective platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          If you wish to disable or remove a third-party API integration, you
          can do so directly through the app settings or by removing the
          integration in the third-party service settings.
        </p>

          6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
          in the app or the third-party APIs. If we make significant changes to
          how we handle your data, we will notify you within the app or through
          other means. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to
          stay informed about how we protect your information.
